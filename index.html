        <p class="bio-text">
          For this project, I decided to make a column for each relevant section: filters,
         sorting, items, cart. I made these titles the biggest to indicate that 
         there were 4 main sections. From there, the items column/section had flags
          with relevant details that were in a smaller font size to indicate a lower 
          status. Finally, I used contrast within the add and remove button for
           each item. Lastly, I decided to frame the cart as one with the items 
           and price along with a reset button.
           <br><br>

        For my application, I decided to use states to keep track of the type of
         items to be displayed, the cart of items, the price of the cart, and whether
          the items should be sorted. I also defined helpers such as: removeFromCart, 
          updateCart, and a comparator function. Overall, I was able to get comfortable
          with the React framework.

        <p class="bio-text">
          Although the start-up, yhangry, had their own website, this design was not
          influnced by them. Instead, a series of brainstorms and sketches led to the
          design. Specifically, it was decided to start the home page with a button called "Book a Chef"
           that would take one to the Chef Selection page. Upon reaching this page, 
           it would prompt one to fill out a filter criteria,
            then the appropriate chefs would appear. Lastly, a nav bar was added
            to help users navigate quickly from the home page, chef selection page,
             and bookings page.
             <br><br>
             In addition to the design process, the user testing was also a success. 
             By using a third party site, I was able to see the strengths and flaws 
             of our design. This helped us modify and perfect our app.

        <p class="bio-text">
          In this project, I interviewed users of the CVS self checkout to better
          understand how they approached a familiar or new interface. Here, the focus
          was consumers since self checkouts are not only found at CVS.
          The takeaways from this assignment was learning how to ask effective 
          questions to gain insight into the user's beliefs and rationale. By creating 
          personas, it deepened the understanding of different types of users and how 
          their needs could be met. Especially for accesibility reasons.

        <h2 class="bio-title">More about Wikipedia Redesign</h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
        In this Wikipedia redesign, problems that arose included: overwhelming
        amount of information, contents page in the middle made navigation difficult,
        a lack of alternative text for when images cannot be produced. Although many
        others have proposed a redesign for Wikipedia, the approach I took was making
        it accessible for those who may have problems with sight. 
        <br><br>
        In the design, I decided to have a navbar at the top so that the user could
        explore the search function, language translation, and other options. Then, I added
        the contents page on the left side and had it fixed so that a user can navigate to 
        any relevant section without having to scroll back up to navigate.
        <br><br>
        Overall, I learned how hard it is to redesign a website since you must account for
        all intended users. In general the tradeoff I made was prioritizing users who had 
        issues with sight.
        <br><br>
            Here you can find the sketches of the redesign.
